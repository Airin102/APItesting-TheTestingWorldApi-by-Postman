# APItesting-TheTestingWorldApi-by-Postman
Here I took API from 'https://thetestingworldapi.com/api' 
Created Collection and tested five API request with different types of method like Post,Put,Get,Delete. 
Created Environment to set redundant values. 
Exported Collection and Environment to run on Command line. 
Set Newman to generate HTML report. 
Here, Json files should be run with Postman/Command line. 
And HTML report file should be run with any browser.
